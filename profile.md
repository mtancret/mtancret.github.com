I am currently a lecturer of Computer Science at
[Iowa State University](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/tancreti) and
[Des Moines Area Community College](https://www.dmacc.edu).
I am also a co-founder of [SensorHound, Inc](http://sensorhound.com).

In 2015, I completed my PhD at Purdue University under the supervision of
[Professor Saurabh Bagchi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sbagchi/) while working
in the [DCSL](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) laboratory.
My primary area of research was dependability and security of sensor networks.
