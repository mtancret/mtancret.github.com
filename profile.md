I am currently a co-founder of [SensorHound, Inc](http://sensorhound.com). In 2015, I
completed my PhD at Purdue University under the supervision of
[Professor Saurabh Bagchi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/).
My primary area of research was in dependability and security of sensor networks.

I enjoy working on an eclectic mix of computing topics including: functional and
logical programming languages, PCB design and manufacture, IoT systems, machine
learning, embedded and systems software, and cloud computing.
