Hardware Enabled Debugging for Sensor Networks
----------------------------------------------

The Telos Debug Board is a hardware device that provides JTAG debugging
capabilities for TelosB motes. We will be presenting
[Aveksha](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/publications/papers/2011/final_debug_board_sensys11_submit.pdf)
at [SenSys 2011](http://sensys.acm.org/2011).

Record and Replay for Sensor Networks
-------------------------------------

I am working on developing a record and replay mechanism for sensor networks.
More information will become available as I reach a working version of the
code.

One side product of the work is
[tinyPack](http://matthew.tancreti.net/tinyPack.html), a library of data
compression algorithms for TinyOS.

Object Oriented Programming for Prolog
--------------------------------------

I have developed a simple framework to enable object oriented programming in
Prolog, with a focus on fast execution time and ease of use. The current
implementation is called [lojeme](http://matthew.tancreti.net/lojeme.html).
