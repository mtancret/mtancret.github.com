Record and Replay for Sensor Networks
-------------------------------------

I am working on developing a record and replay mechanism for sensor networks.
More information will become available as I reach a working version of the
code.

One side product of the work is
[tinyPack](http://matthew.tancreti.net/tinyPack.html), a library of data
compression algorithms for TinyOS.

Telos Debug Board
-----------------

The Telos Debug Board is a hardware device that provides JTAG debugging
capabilities for TelosB motes. More information to come.
