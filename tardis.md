Trace And Replay Debugging In Sensornets (TARDIS) is a software approach for
system-level record and replay of embedded nodes, particularly in wireless
sensor networks. System-level means that it is able to replay a complete execution
down to individual insturctions. TARDIS is able to record all sources of
non-determinism, based on the observation that such information is compressible
using a combination of techniques specialized for respective sources. Despite their
domain-specific nature, the techniques presented are applicable to the broader class
of resource-constrained embedded systems.
