Aveksha is a hardware-software approach for non-intrusively tracing and profiling
sensor network nodes. The hardware prototype we have created is the Telos Debug
Board (TDB). This board is capable of interfacing with the JTAG port on a Telos
(Rev B) mote. It can poll a watchpoint buffer or PC register of the target
processor, while at the same time taking energy readings of the mote. We will
be presenting Aveksha and demoing the TDB at
[SenSys 2011](http://sensys.acm.org/2011) in Seattle, WA on Nov 1-4.
